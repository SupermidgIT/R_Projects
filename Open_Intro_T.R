## a statistion collects data from a "sample" in order to generalize results to an entire "population".

## CONTINUOUS VARIABLE is one that can assume any value within the scope of the problem.
  ## for the cars data set price, city MPG, and weight are all continuous variables.

## DISCRETE VARIABLE is a variable that may take on of a limited, and usally fixed, number of possible values.
  ## the number of passengers is a discrete variable

## CATEGORICAL VARIABLE is similar to a discrete variable, however, instead of assuming a fixed value, the variable is ascribed a fixed categorical description.
  ## drive train are examples of categorical variables.


    ## CENTRAL TENDENCY


range() ## for minimum and maximum values of the data set.

mean() ## to get the mean of a data set.
sort() ## sort a vector of factor into ascending or desending order.
median() ## gives you the median of a data set.

  ## Cental tendency are very useful in briefly summarizing a data set, and finding the best representation of the central or average value of a data set.

## Another important property specific to each data set is a measue of how spread out or clustered the data values are.

## DISPERION or VARIABILITY - interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation.

## Box and Whisker plots ##

## For finding the approximate interquartile range subtract the q1 - q3

## VARIANCE is the average of the squared differences from the mean. variance just represents the total distance of the data from the mean of the data.
## STANDARD DEVIATION is calculated as the square root of the variance. it is expressed in the same units as the original data values.
